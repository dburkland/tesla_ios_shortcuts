The Tesla legacy shortcuts were created based on the excellent examples shared by u/jn1cks of reddit.com in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ahe5be/i_created_a_siri_shortcut_that_wakes_up_my_tesla/. 

In order to import the shortcuts you will first need to allow the import of untrusted shortcuts. This can be done by completing the steps documented [here](https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/14/allow-untrusted-shortcuts-ios-13/). You can then click on the link next to "Download Tesla Legacy Shortcuts" to download & install the shortcut downloader. With the shortcut downloader installed please execute it via the Shortcuts app to downlad each of the shortcuts. Once each shortcut has been imported into the Shortcuts app on your device, you will then need to execute the "Generate Tesla Token" shortcut. This results in the creation of an authentication token that is used to communicate with your car. Once that is complete you can then execute any of the other Tesla shortcuts.

### FAQs

* What can you do if you receive error messages like this one: ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EHQXnncXYAEvPbZ?format=jpg&name=medium)
  * Delete the "Generate Tesla Token" shortcut and re-import it.
  * Execute the re-imported "Generate Tesla Token" shortcut, this time making sure to select "Allow" when prompted.
  * Re-run the Tesla shortcut that you originally tried to execute.
* How can I call these shortcuts using "Hey Siri"?
  * The name of the shortcut is automatically setup as the voice command phrase that Siri recognizes. 
  * If you would prefer another shortcut voice command phrase, you can simply rename the shortcut (after it is imported) in the Shortcuts app to whatever you like.
  * Once the shortcut is named appropriately, simply say "Hey Siri <Name of Shortcut>".
  * NOTE: Please keep in mind that the shortcut name must be unique from other shortcuts in your library. As an example, I tried to rename **Turn on HVAC Normal** to **Turn on Heat**, but that command is associated with HomeKit so it doesn't work. **Turn Heat On** however works perfectly fine.
* How secure are these shortcuts?
  * The authentication token that is generated by the "Generate Tesla Token" shortcut is stored in your personal iCloud Drive. The shortcut is only visible to apps or services that have access to your iCloud drive meaning folks cannot publicly access this data by default. 
  * Each of the shortcuts leverage TLS when communicating with Tesla just like the official Tesla app
  * I do not log or record any usage data, nor do I log or record any of the generated Tesla API tokens.
